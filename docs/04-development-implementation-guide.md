## Development Methodology

### Waterfall Development Approach

As specified, we will follow the waterfall model for this project. The comprehensive documentation we've created will serve as the blueprint for implementation with the following characteristics:

- **Complete Up-Front Planning**: All requirements and designs are finalized before coding begins
- **Sequential Phases**: Each phase must be completed before the next begins
- **Thorough Documentation**: Detailed specs allow for predictable development
- **Milestone-Based Progress**: Clear checkpoints for evaluation
- **Change Management**: Formal process for any requirement changes

### Development Standards

#### Code Quality Guidelines
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- **Linting**: ESLint with Airbnb rules + custom overrides
- **Formatting**: Prettier with standardized config
- **Comments**: JSDoc style for functions and components
- **Naming**: Consistent camelCase/PascalCase conventions

#### Git Workflow
```

  └── development
      ├── feature/auth-system
      ├── feature/user-management
      ├── feature/shipping-integration
      └── feature/credit-system
```

- **Branch Naming**: `feature/feature-name`, `bugfix/issue-number`
- **Commit Style**: Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- **Pull Requests**: Required for all merges to development
- **Code Review**: Minimum 1 reviewer per PR
- **Merge Strategy**: Squash and merge to maintain clean history
